Objectives
1. Consider ways to represent metadata about data structures  
 - in the form of an abstract syntactic tree (AST)
 - as a directed graph
 - In the form of a data model using aggregation, inheritance, and usage relationships
2. Using metadata to implement typical operations
- creation
- cleanup
- assignment
- comparison of two values
- equality
- hash receipt
- serialization
- collection implementation
- sorting
- generating typical design patterns
3. Implementation of typical operations in the form of AST (Intermediate Program ?Represenatation)
4. AST translation into a specific programming language
5.  AST translation to LLVM
6.  Translation from one programming language to another using AST
7. Language for describing object data model using aggregation, inheritance and usage relations
